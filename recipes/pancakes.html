    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple, no-fail recipe for light and fluffy pancakes that are perfect for a weekend breakfast. This recipe uses
        common ingredients you likely already have in your kitchen. Serve them warm with your favorite toppings like
        maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg, and melted butter; mix until just smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.</li>
        <li>Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
